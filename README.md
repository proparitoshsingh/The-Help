# The Help - Emotion Analysis through Recorded Video Conferencing

## Introduction
"The Help" project offers a comprehensive solution for analyzing emotions in recorded video conferences to help medical professionals as thus the patients. It combines WebRTC technology for video conferencing capabilities, a desktop application developed using Electron for emotion analysis, and FER (Facial Expression Recognition) with TensorFlow for emotion detection. This platform allows users to capture video conferences, assess emotions afterward, and depict emotional patterns through visual graphs.

## Features
1. **Electron Desktop Application:** Developed with Electron, the desktop application facilitates emotion analysis in recorded video conferences.
2. **WebRTC Video Conferencing:** Utilizes WebRTC technology to enable video conferencing functionalities within the application.
3. **FER and TensorFlow Integration:** Incorporates FER library with TensorFlow for facial expression recognition and emotion analysis.
4. **Recorded Video Conferences:** Allows users to record video conferences for subsequent analysis.
5. **Emotion Analysis:** Performs detailed analysis of recorded video conferences to detect and visualize emotions.
6. **Graphical Representation:** Presents emotion analysis results through graphical representations, aiding in understanding emotional dynamics.
7. **User-friendly Interface:** Offers an intuitive interface for easy interaction and seamless user experience.

## How to Use
1. **Start a Video Conference:** Initiate or join a video conference using the WebRTC functionality within the application.
2. **Record the Conference:** Record the video conference session for future analysis by enabling the recording feature.
3. **Save Recorded Video:** After the conference, save the recorded video locally on your device for analysis.
4. **Launch "The Help" Application:** Open the Electron desktop application for emotion analysis.
5. **Upload Recorded Video:** Upload the recorded video conference file to the application for emotion analysis.
6. **Analyze Emotions:** The application will analyze the emotions depicted in the recorded video conference.
7. **View Emotion Analysis:** Visualize the emotional dynamics through graphical representations generated by the application.


## Repository Structure
- **app(ElectronApp):** Contains the code for the Electron desktop application.
- **site(WebRTCServer):** Includes the code for the WebRTC video conferencing website.
- **PyScript:** The python script that is used to detect the emotional features from any given video file using FER library.
